"""What a number depended on, captured so "we varied one thing" can be checked.

An eval measures three things — the SYSTEM UNDER TEST, the INSTRUMENT (the adapter: its
`call_system` and its `score`) and the DATA (dataset + reference). A number is only
interpretable if all three are identified, and a COMPARISON is only valid if exactly one
of them moved. Without a fingerprint that is an assertion; with one it is checkable.

STDLIB ONLY, deliberately. This module must never import torch, transformers,
scikit-learn or any provider SDK. Someone evaluating a pure-LLM system, or a regex
baseline, should never install an ML framework to use this harness — the experiment
brings its own weight, and the core only knows how to ASK.

Which is why the model half is inverted: the core defines a VOCABULARY, not a mechanism.
An adapter may expose

    def fingerprint(params) -> dict

and return whatever identifies ITS system, in this shape:

    {"id": ..., "revision": ..., "revision_source": ..., "device": ..., "precision": ...}

`revision_source` is never parsed here — it exists for whoever reads the run later, and
says HOW the revision was determined: "hf-snapshot", "ollama-digest", "gguf-sha256",
"sklearn-artifact", "api-model-string". A HuggingFace cache layout is a HuggingFace
concept and has no business in this file.

A missing revision is recorded as missing. The core does not invent one — two runs of
"the same model" that cannot prove they used the same weights should say so rather than
imply a reproducibility they do not have.
