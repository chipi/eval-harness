"""Rank every arm that ran on one dataset — quality, cost and speed together.

`run-compare` answers "is B better than A". When you sweep four models you want
one table, not six pairwise comparisons, and you want the three axes side by
side because they trade against each other:

    the best output is often the slowest and dearest, and the decision is
    usually "which is good ENOUGH per dollar", not "which scores highest"

Runs are grouped by `config_id`, so repeats of the same arm collapse into one
row and their spread is shown — an arm whose own spread exceeds the gap to its
neighbour is not distinguishable from it, and the table says so.

#
# THREE readings, all order-independent, all computed over the whole table at once.
# What is NOT used: any walk down the table comparing each arm to a running "leader".
# That is a sorting algorithm, not a comparison -- its answer depends on whether you
# walk top-down or bottom-up, and on this data those two directions disagree about
# whether the top arm is separated from the field at all.

#: Two per-item values closer than this count as tied.
#:
#: 1e-9 is right for scores stored at full precision and WRONG for scores rounded on the
#: way to disk: at 6 decimals, arms that genuinely tie can land ~1e-6 apart and get
#: strictly ordered. The previous comment here claimed this tolerance "absorbs the
#: 6-decimal rounding". It does not.
#:
#: The fix is not a looser constant -- 1e-6 would merge a real gap (the closest distinct
#: rouge1 means on this data are 8.8e-7 apart). It is to notice the precision and say so,
#: so low-precision runs get rescored rather than quietly mis-tied.

#: Raw per-item values as they came off disk, before any averaging. Precision has to be
