"""Run one experiment config against one dataset; emit a run directory.

A run records THREE things, and is worthless without all of them:

    system under test   which build produced these numbers  (build.ref)
    instrument          which config was used               (config_id)
    data                what it was measured on             (dataset_id)

Drop any one and the number cannot be attributed to anything.

REPEAT is not a convenience. Before believing a delta between two arms you must
know the arm's own run-to-run spread — otherwise you are promoting noise. A real
example: one ASR model showed 0.058 WER spread on BYTE-IDENTICAL input, wider
than most deltas anyone was arguing about.

    python scripts/experiment_run.py --config data/configs/demo.yaml
    python scripts/experiment_run.py --config data/configs/demo.yaml --repeat 3

WIRING YOUR SYSTEM IN: edit `scripts/adapter.py`. Nothing in this file needs to
change — it times the call, records what it cost, scores the output against the
reference if one exists, and aggregates. That split is the point: the generic
half stays generic.
