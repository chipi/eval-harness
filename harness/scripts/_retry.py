"""Retrying transient provider failures. Generic infrastructure, not domain logic.

This lives in the CORE, not in an adapter, because of how it was learned. The bundled
demo adapter had retries and honoured `EVAL_MAX_RETRIES`, so the knob looked wired up
everywhere — and the summarisation example, which defined its own adapter, had none at
all. Two sweeps lost an arm to a single upstream 429: ~20 paid calls thrown away, and
the run reported "ARM FAILED" as though the model could not do the task.

Raising `EVAL_MAX_RETRIES` did nothing, because the adapter doing the work never read it.
That is the failure mode this module exists to prevent: an adapter author should get
retries by not thinking about it, rather than by remembering to copy twenty lines.

    attempts        EVAL_MAX_RETRIES       default 8
    delay cap       EVAL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY   default 60 seconds

Backoff doubles — 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 … — and then flattens at the cap, so the wait grows
quickly while a blip is likely and then stops growing rather than running away. Jitter is
added so that N arms retrying after the same upstream hiccup do not return in lockstep
and cause the next one.
