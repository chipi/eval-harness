"""THE INTEGRATION SEAM. This is the file you edit; the rest is bookkeeping.

You already have a system — a summariser, a classifier, an extractor, a RAG
chain. This file is where you hand it to the harness. Two functions:

    call_system(text, params)  -> what your system produces, plus what it cost
    score(output, reference)   -> how good that output was

Everything else — freezing datasets, hashing, provenance, timing, aggregation,
the refusals — is generic and does not change.

`call_system` returns a `Result`, and the fields beyond `output` are optional.
Return what your system can tell you; the harness records whatever arrives and
skips what does not. Cost and token counts are the difference between "model B
is better" and "model B is better and costs 4x", which is usually the actual
decision.
