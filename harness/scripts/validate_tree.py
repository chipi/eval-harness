"""Integrity checks over the eval tree. Run it before you trust any number.

Each check exists because its absence let a real defect through somewhere:

  V1  schemas        a document that violates its own contract
  V2  dataset_id     a run citing a dataset that does not exist — the number
                     cannot be attributed to any data
  V3  provenance     a run with no build ref — the number cannot be attributed
                     to any code
  V4  materialized   a dataset whose materialized copy drifted from its hashes
  V5  duplicates     two runs reporting byte-identical scores on the same
                     dataset. Independent arms do not agree to full float
                     precision; one of them is not its own measurement
  V6  baselines      a baseline pointing at a run that no longer exists

Exit 1 on any failure, so it can gate.
