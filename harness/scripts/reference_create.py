"""Establish ground truth for a dataset, so later runs have something to be scored against.

THE CHICKEN AND EGG: you cannot measure quality without something to measure
against, and most projects have no ground truth for the thing they actually
ship. The usual answers:

  gold    a human wrote it. Expensive, slow, and the only thing you can
          honestly call correct.
  silver  a model you trust wrote it. Cheap, plentiful, and NOT the same
          thing — it encodes that model's opinion, including its mistakes.

This script produces SILVER by default and says so in the manifest. That is a
legitimate starting point: a consistent reference lets you rank arms against
each other today, and you can replace items with human-authored gold later
without changing anything downstream.

What it must never do is let you forget which you have. `make validate` reads
the manifest, and every run scored against silver carries that fact.

    make reference-create DATASET_ID=my_v1 CONFIG=data/configs/golden.yaml
    make reference-create DATASET_ID=my_v1 CONFIG=... TIER=gold   # human-reviewed

Cost: one call per item, against whatever the config names. Start with a small
dataset — a 10-item golden pass is enough to rank four arms.
