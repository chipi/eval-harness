"""How good is a MODEL-AUTHORED reference as a stand-in for a trusted one?

Most of the time you have no gold. The usual move is to have a strong model write the
references — "silver" — and rank your candidates against those. This asks the question
nobody asks: **does that ranking match the one real ground truth would have given?**

It costs nothing. "Author silver with model X, same prompt and settings as the arms" is
exactly what X already produced on this dataset, so every arm on disk is a candidate
silver author and all of them can be tried at once.

For each candidate author A:
    use A's outputs as the reference set
    score every OTHER arm against them, and rank those arms
    compare that ranking to the one the TRUSTED reference gives for the same arms

A's own row is excluded throughout — an author that also competes scores itself first,
and that artifact is not the interesting part.

    make silver-calibrate DATASET_ID=my_v1 REF_MATCH=_v1 ARM_MATCH=_v2

Read the output against the CEILING it prints. Two runs of the same arms against the
same gold do not rank identically either, so the gold-vs-gold retest correlation is the
best any proxy could score. A silver at rho 0.5 against a ceiling of 0.93 is not "fairly
good"; it is about half of the available agreement.

`--group-by` (default `family`) reports the bias that matters most and that excluding the
author does NOT remove: whether a silver author systematically promotes models of its own
kind.
