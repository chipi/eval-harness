"""Compare two runs — and REFUSE when the comparison would be meaningless.

The refusals are the feature. A tool that always produces a number teaches you
to trust numbers that mean nothing:

  * different `dataset_id`  -> refused outright. Two metrics measured on
    different data are not comparable; the result would be a coincidence
    wearing a delta's clothes.
  * same build on both sides -> reported. If the code did not change, the
    delta is instrument or noise, not an improvement.
  * a delta smaller than the arm's own spread -> flagged as noise, with the
    command that measures that spread.
