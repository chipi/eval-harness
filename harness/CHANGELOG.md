# Changelog

Every release of the harness, newest first: what it shipped, and what a project pinning it
should know. These are the release notes. The same section is the text of the release's
GitHub Release, and the findings site shows them at
[evals.humancopilot.eu/releases.html](https://evals.humancopilot.eu/releases.html).

The version lives in `scripts/_version.py`; a release is the git tag `v<version>`, and the
release workflow refuses a tag that disagrees with that file or has no section here. A change
that can move a result is never a patch release without saying so under **Changed**.

## 0.4.0 — unreleased

Catalog, run inspector and goals in the harness ([ADR-0002](https://github.com/chipi/eval-harness/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-0002-catalog-inspector-goals.md)).
Built on one branch, layer by layer, and released once. Done so far: one implementation of the
paired test, `evaluation_harness.stats`, shared by `pair-test`, `family-test` and the run
inspector; and the catalog and run inspector themselves, for any project.

### Changed
- **Exact p-values at 30 items or fewer.** `pair-test` and `family-test` now count the
  two-sided sign-flip p over all 2^n sign patterns when a pair shares 30 items or fewer, instead
  of estimating it from 20,000 seeded permutations. Above 30 items the estimate is unchanged,
  bit for bit, including `family-test`'s single stream across opponents. Near a threshold the
  estimate could land on either side of it; the count cannot. **This can move a result**:
  - **in this repository's reports:** none moved. All 201 report claims re-derive unchanged,
    because every published pair and family test is on more than 30 items;
  - **in the tutorial** (6 items): `pair-test` reads 0.0312 (was 0.0330) and the family test
    0.0938, 0.3125, 0.5625. The verdicts are the same (GUIDE steps 6 and 8);
  - **in your project:** re-run `pair-test` / `family-test` on any pair with 30 or fewer
    shared items. Whether a verdict near its threshold moves depends on your data.
- `pair-test` says which it did: `(exact, all 2^n sign patterns)` or `(20000 permutations)`.
- `family-test`'s cache key includes `stats.py`, so a cached answer from 0.3.0 is recomputed.
- **`validate` V4 no longer passes what it did not check.** A materialized copy that has lost
  an item file now fails; it used to be skipped. A dataset with no materialized copy on the
  machine (materialized data is not committed, so a CI job has none) is named as not checked,
  and the ok line says how many were checked, e.g. "3 of 14 datasets materialized here". A
  project whose materialized copy is incomplete goes red where it was green.

### Added
- **`evaluation_harness.stats`**. Standard library only, and the one place the paired test
  lives:
  - `exact_p` and `sign_flip_p`;
  - `holm`, with a declared family larger than the p-values passed;
  - `exact_ci`, an interval for the mean difference that agrees with the test: none at 5
    items or fewer, where no shift can be rejected;
  - `compare`, every arm against a baseline with verdicts in words.

  It has its own test suite, `scripts/test_stats.py`, run by `make test`.
- **`evh catalog` and `evh catalog-serve`** (`make catalog`, `make catalog-serve`).
  - **The catalog:** static pages over a project's runs, by dataset, built into
    `.build/catalog/`. Each dataset page lists every arm with its headline number, and links
    to the inspector for one arm or all of them.
  - **The run inspector:** a server on 127.0.0.1 that tests any arms on one dataset against
    a baseline with `stats.py`, so it gives the same p as `pair-test` on the same pair. It
    shows the verdicts, charts of the per-item scores and differences, and, for one item,
    each arm's output beside the reference.
  - **The same rules as everywhere else:**
    - Arms on different `dataset_id`s are refused.
    - The static pages carry counts and means only, never an item's text.
    - The server answers only to a 127.0.0.1 Host. It serves only the catalog and the
      data tree, and no dot-folder in either.
  - **An adapter is the only project code needed.** `catalog_adapter.Adapter` lists the
    questions both tools ask. The built-in `HarnessAdapter` reads the harness's own layout
    (`runs*/`, `runs-judged/`, `references/`): an arm is one config on one dataset, its
    repeats averaged per item. A project with another layout names its own adapter in
    `config.yaml` (`catalog: {adapter: path/to/file.py:Class}`) or passes `--adapter`.

  Tests: `scripts/test_catalog.py` (26 assertions), run by `make test`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-21

Re-measure what you already have. Stored outputs can now be scored again by LLM judges, as an
optional pass that never touches a committed run: `evh judge-score`, for any text task you
declare (what an item is, what the outputs are, the dimensions, the scale). The harness refuses
a judge until the scorer names, for each judge, a committed run that measured it against human
ratings; it runs at least two judges from different vendors blind, measures their position bias
and noise, and stores every verdict so a rerun costs $0. The tutorial has an offline, $0
judging step (GUIDE step 10). Upgrading from 0.2.0 changes no committed run or score and adds
no dependency. Design: [ADR-0001](https://github.com/chipi/eval-harness/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-0001-judge-scorers.md);
what it found here: the [judging page](https://evals.humancopilot.eu/experiments/judging.html).

### Added
- **`evh judge-score`** (and `make judge-score`). Re-measure an experiment's frozen outputs
  with a validated LLM judge, billed, cost-capped and resumable. It runs from the installed
  package in a project that has only its own data directory, scorer, prompt and runs: the
  prompt builder, reply parser, tau-b and Spearman, and an OpenAI-compatible judge client
  (LiteLLM proxy, OpenRouter direct, per-judge `base_url` / `api_key_env`, billed cost read
  from the response, retries) are in `evaluation_harness.judging`, with no dependency on
  `examples/`.
- **The judge scorer artifact** (`data/scorers/<id>.yaml`): two or more judges from different
  vendor families, the task, the prompt (with its sha256), the protocol, a `validation`
  block and a cost cap.
- **Any text task, declared in the scorer.** An optional `task` block names what each item is
  (`source_label`), what the arms wrote (`output_label`), the `dimensions` the judge scores
  and the `scale`; a prompt writes `{n}` where the number of outputs per call goes. Without a
  `task` block a scorer judges SummEval's news-summary task (ARTICLE, SUMMARIES, four
  dimensions, 1-5), byte for byte as before. A declared task is hashed into the judging set.
- **A judging step in the tutorial** (`docs/GUIDE.md` step 10):
  `harness/tutorial/scorers/tickets-judge-v1.yaml` re-measures the tutorial's arms with two
  fake judges, offline and $0,
  through the refusal, the dry run, the pass and the leaderboard.
- **A validation gate.** A scorer runs only if its `validation` block names a committed run
  for each judge whose metric equals the stated value (and is at least `min_metric`, when the
  scorer sets one) and whose model, temperature, reasoning, provider, max tokens, prompt file
  and prompt sha256 are the judge's. The gate checks that a validation exists and is current,
  not that it transfers to your outputs. Otherwise `--unvalidated` runs it and labels every number
  "unvalidated judge". `provider: fake` judges (offline, free, for testing a scorer) can never
  pass the gate.
- **Judging sets and stored verdicts.** One item is the article plus every arm's output, arm
  identities hidden, order shuffled by a seed; the set is hashed into its id and frozen in
  `data/judging-sets/`. Every reply is stored per call in `data/judge-verdicts/`, with its
  scores, so a rerun resumes and re-reading costs $0; a reply that is not bare JSON scores, or
  repeats 8 consecutive words of the item or an output, is kept only as its hash, since a
  judge that reasons aloud can copy the source. A different arm set is a new set, never an
  append. A block retried with `--retry-unparsed` keeps the earlier calls' cost in its record.
- **Controls.** A position check (a second shuffle that re-forms the blocks) and a noise check
  (a repeat on a subset), plus per-judge agreement and a self-family flag, in `summary.json`.
- **Adjudicated gold re-measurement** (repository tooling, `examples/_shared/adjudicate.py`,
  not in the package): a committed adjudication file overwrites only the disputed items of a
  local gold reference set to make a new reference version, and `rescore` re-scores every run
  against it for $0, the old reference kept beside it.
- **Judge validation on published human ratings** (repository tooling, not in the package):
  `validate_judge_goyal.py` (Goyal, Li & Durrett 2022) and `validate_judge_zhang.py` (Zhang et
  al. 2024, crowd ratings of 19 LLM-era summarisers) check a scorer's judges against people.
  The ratings are downloaded when the check runs, pinned by sha256, and never committed; the
  committed records hold article ids, the judges' replies and scores, and hashes; a reply that
  is not bare JSON scores, or repeats 8 consecutive words of the source, is kept only as its hash.
- **`validate` V11-V13.** V11: every judging set's stored hash is the hash of its content.
  V12: every stored verdict names a real set, item, pass and block, and its `n` is that
  block's size, and every committed judge reply (verdicts and validation records) is bare
  JSON or kept only as its hash. V13: every judge scorer loads, is structurally valid (its `task` included),
  and its prompt file resolves and renders. They read the configured data directory.
- **`judge-score` judges every arm on the dataset by default.** A scorer's `arms_match`,
  `--match` and `--arms` narrow it, and it warns when the arm set mixes config versions (`_v1`
  and `_v2` of one arm are judged as two arms).
- **A scorer's `prompt.file` resolves against the project root**, then the scorer file's own
  directory, then (in a checkout of this repository only) the repository root.
- **Judged runs carry no `reference_tier`**, since a judge reads no reference: the source
  run's tier is kept as `judged_with.source_reference_tier`, and `leaderboard` says the scores
  come from a judge, with its label.
- **A refused judge call stops the pass cleanly.** A call refused, or still failing after its
  retries (a provider's own budget guardrail answering 403, for example), stops the pass the
  way the cost cap does: every stored verdict is kept, the partial result is projected and
  labelled, and the same command resumes.
- **Scorer checks.** `task.scale` must be whole numbers, and a prompt with both `{n}` and
  SummEval's fixed count phrases is refused (the phrases would keep saying 16). V13 renders
  each prompt at 2 outputs, so a prompt that cannot be rendered fails there, not at run time.
- Experiment-level results this enables are reported in the repository's reports (the
  summarisation experiment re-measured with two pairs of SummEval-validated judges, not confirmed by people on those outputs; AG News and DBpedia
  against adjudicated gold); none of them is in the package.

### Changed
- **`leaderboard`'s precision note** no longer fires on values that are exact small-integer
  fractions (a mean of 1-5 ratings over two judges and four dimensions is in eighths); scores
  rounded on the way to disk still get it.
- Nothing that scores a run changed: committed runs and their recorded hashes are untouched,
  and the committed summarisation judging set rebuilds from its stored verdicts with the same
  id.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-20

The first version meant to be installed rather than copied: pin a release tag, run `evh`, and
your project's data stays in your project, never in the installed package. Runs now record
which harness produced them, other tools' scores can be imported as runs, and the paired tests
handle lower-is-better metrics.

### Added
- **Installable package.** `pip install "evaluation-harness @ git+https://github.com/chipi/eval-harness@v0.2.0#subdirectory=harness"`
  gives the `evh` command: every Makefile target, running the same scripts.
- **`EVAL_HOME` / `EVAL_DATA_DIR`.** The project's data lives in the project, never in the
  installed package; the data root can be nested (for example `data/eval/stats`).
- **The harness identifies itself in every run.** `fingerprint.instrument.harness` gains
  `version`, `code_sha256` and `installed`.
- **`evh import-run`.** Per-item scores produced by another tool become a run the
  significance tests read, with the source, the scorer and the sha256 of the imported bytes
  on the record.
- **`--asc` for `pair-test` and `family-test`.** For lower-is-better metrics, "wins" and
  "ahead" count the lower score. The p-values were already two-sided and do not change.

### Changed
- `validate`'s V9 evidence floors are read from `<data>/validate_floors.json` (project
  policy) instead of being hardcoded for this repository's run directories.
- The `family-test` cache lives under the project root, not beside the code.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-19

The harness as first published with its six worked experiments, before it was packaged: a copy
you take into your project rather than install. Frozen, hash-checked datasets; one adapter
function for your system; runs that record their data, prompt, code, model and build; each
arm's own noise; paired tests with Holm correction that say separated or tied; billed cost
beside quality; re-scoring from stored outputs for $0; validation that fails CI; baselines
promoted only with a reason. Tagged afterwards, at the commit the site was deployed from on
2026-10-19 (`9454f19`), so a project that took a copy that week can name what it took. What
changed between this copy and 0.2.0, including fixes that can move results:
