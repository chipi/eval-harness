"""ML vs LLM on CNN/DailyMail. The seam for this example.

An arm here is a YAML file naming a model. That is the whole point: when a model ships,
you add one config and get an answer instead of an impression.

    provider: hf_local   a summariser running on this machine.   cost 0. Needs torch.
    provider: litellm    a hosted model through the proxy.       cost > 0. Needs openai.

Neither import happens until an arm asks for it, so the LLM arms run without torch
installed and the local arm runs without a network.

WHAT THE SCORERS ARE FOR
  A facet earns its place only if it can point the OPPOSITE way to another one. Four here:

    rouge1          word coverage
    rouge2 / rougeL right words in the right ORDER. A summary using the right words in the
                    wrong order scores high rouge1 and low rouge2/L, and that gap is
                    extractive-vs-abstractive — invisible in any single number.
    compression     summary length / article length. Disagrees with ROUGE, which rises
                    with length: a verbose model wins ROUGE and fails the task.
    grounding       share of summary bigrams present in the article. This is the one ROUGE
                    cannot do. ROUGE cannot tell a good paraphrase from a confident
                    fabrication — both merely differ from the reference. Expect an LLM to
                    beat BART on ROUGE AND ground less: better and riskier at once, which
                    is the finding worth shipping this example for.

  grounding and compression are OURS, ~20 lines, so they are not comparable to anybody
  else's numbers. ROUGE is `rouge-score`, the implementation the papers use, so those are.

#: What THIS adapter's metrics mean. The core classifies the ones it ships; an example
#: brings its own vocabulary and must say which are quality and which merely describe the
#: output. Without it the leaderboard ranked a ten-model sweep by `compression` — a length
#: ratio — and its own "that is a descriptive metric" warning stayed silent, because by the
#: core's tuples compression looked like quality.
#: The headline facet. Coverage, not concision: the question this example exists to ask
#: is "did the summary carry the story", and the terseness half is the counterweight you
#: read beside it -- not the thing that decides the ranking. Sorting alphabetically made
#: `concision` the default and put the shortest arms on top.
#: Extra failure shapes worth retrying for THIS adapter, on top of the core's list.
#: The core owns the universal ones (429, 503, "rate limit"); an adapter adds only what
#: is peculiar to its own backends. Retrying itself is the harness's job -- this example
#: carried its own copy for exactly one afternoon, which is one afternoon too long for
#: infrastructure every adapter needs.
